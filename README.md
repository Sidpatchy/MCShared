A small library containing common functionality for Minecraft plugins.

# Usage
I recommend using [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io/) to add this as a dependency within your project. From there you can either shade the library in, or add it as a dependency that users must download.

If you are a user just searching for the download link, you can get it here: https://ci.sidpatchy.com/job/MCShared/
